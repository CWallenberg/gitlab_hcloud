# GitLab Runner Orchestrator for Hetzner Cloud

Automatic provisioning of Hetzner Cloud servers as GitLab CI runners - **pay only when you need it**.

## Features

- **Automatic server creation** when pipelines are pending/running
- **Cost-optimized deletion** - server is deleted 5 minutes before the next billing cycle
- **Polls all projects** - one runner for the entire GitLab instance
- **State persistence** - survives restarts without data loss
- **CSV logging** - documents all server starts/stops with reason and duration
- **Rotating log files** - daily rotation

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the binary

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Create configuration

On first start, `config/config.example.toml` is automatically created. Copy and customize it:

```bash
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
# Edit config/config.toml with your API keys
```

### 3. Create runner configuration

Create `config/runner.toml` with your GitLab Runner configuration.
You can register the GitLab Runner with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ./config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest register --url https://gitlab.example.com --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

**IMPORTANT:**
Under `[runners.docker]` there is a `pull_policy` setting.
Set it to:

```toml
pull_policy = ["if-not-present"]
```

Otherwise the runner will do too many `docker image pull` requests and your IP will be banned!

### 4. Start

```bash
cargo run --release
# or
./target/release/hetzner_gitlab_runner
```

## Configuration

### config/config.toml

```toml
[gitlab]
url = "https://gitlab.example.com"
token = "glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"  # read_api scope

[hetzner]
token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
server_type = "ccx23"      # AMD dedicated CPU
location = "nbg1"          # Nuremberg
image = "ubuntu-24.04"
ssh_key_name = "my-ssh-key"

[runner]
name = "flexi-runner"
min_lifetime_minutes = 20  # Minimum runtime
poll_interval_seconds = 30
```

## Debug vs Release

| Feature          | Debug     | Release                              |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Polling interval | 5s        | 30s (from config)                    |
| Server deletion  | Immediate | After min. 20min + billing-optimized |

## Billing Optimization

Hetzner charges per **started hour from server creation**.

Example:

- Server created at 14:47
- Pipeline finished at 15:10 (server ran 23min)
- Next billing cycle: 15:47
- Server is deleted at 15:42 (5min buffer)
  This ensures that if the server is needed again, the runner doesn't have to be set up again. Hetzner charges per started hour, meaning 5x10min = 5x60min billed.

## Logs

- `logs/orchestrator.log` - Detailed logs (daily rotation)
- `logs/runner_usage.csv` - Server usage documentation
